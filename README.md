# timetrekkr 🏆 2nd Place @ ProduHacks 2023 🏆
> An interactive storyboard for kids!

## Inspiration
Children are the world's best learners. We want to nurture and encourage children's inquisitive nature for history and provide a medium for them to explore historical events at their own pace.

## What it Does
An interactive storyboard that embarks users on a magical journey through time – in our case, Ancient Egypt! Children have the opportunity to interact with features such as hover animations and clickable images as they learn about the Nile River, Egyptian Pyramids, and the Great Sphynx of Giza. Text-to-speech technology can read the story out loud to children, increasing its accessibility to those whose reading abilities aren't as advanced. An AI-powered fun fact generator will give you almost an infinite number of fun historical facts that happened on the current date!

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- OpenAI API
- Web Speech API

## Challenges We Ran Into
One of the biggest challenges we ran into was creating a cohesive and visually compelling illustration that reflected the natural progression of time throughout history. Another challenge was developing a historically accurate, informative, yet simple-to-understand story that children can understand and will want to continuously engage with.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
After being stuck in the brainstorming phase and repeatedly revisiting the drawing board for almost three hours, the vision we had for our product finally clicked. One key accomplishment is that our entire storyboard illustration is drawn by hand by our designer. We are proud to say that TimeTrekkr.ai is created with love by our designer, developer, and product managers. It was also our first time implementing AI and Text-to-Speech in an app.
